# keystone_spreadsheet
pulls data of recent keys from raiderIO API and makes a CSV of the data

This is my first project involving pulling data from an API.
I wanted to be able to create a spreadsheet of all the Mythic Keystone Dungeons I did in World of Warcraft across all my characters, without manually entering all the data and navigating to all the web pages separately.

This function takes a character name and realm and pulls the 10 most recent mythic keystones by that character and adds any new ones to the csv.
I have created some basic visualizations of the data in Tableau.
